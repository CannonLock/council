# Open Science Grid Consortium By-Laws

## Purpose of the Open Science Grid Consortium

The Open Science Grid Consortium is a consortium of scientific collaborations,
scientific computing centers and existing and new grid research and deployment
projects, involving both computational and application scientists, working
together to provide and support the set of facilities, services and
infrastructure needed to provide a persistent national grid infrastructure for
large scale US science: the Open Science Grid.

## Organizational Structure

The governing bodies of the OSG Consortium are the OSG Council and the OSG
Executive Team (The organizational structure is detailed in
[the OSG management plan](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=314))

*   The **OSG Council** provides the scientific coordination and oversight of OSG activities.

*   The **Council Chairpersons** are self-elected by the Council to lead the council.

*   The **Executive Director** is elected by the Council to manage programmatic
    activities with the help of an Executive Team.

*   The **Executive Team** is appointed by the Executive Director to direct the OSG
    program of work (details of the program of work may be found in
    [the OSG Management Plan](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=314)),
    draw up policies and
    represent the OSG Consortium in dealing with other organizations and committees.
    All appointments to the Executive Team are subject to council approval.

NOTE: Users of and providers to the OSG do not need to be affiliated with OSG member organizations.

## Membership of the Consortium

Consortium Membership occurs through completed registration of
a resource, VO, or other organization with the OSG through the Operations Registration process.
Consortium Members contribute to and/or benefit directly from
the resources, use, operations and/ or other activities.
Consortium members recognize that the OSG is a sharing eco-system and
strive to maximize the sharing of computing resources, software, and other assets to enable science.

Consortium Partners collaborate with the OSG as peer organizations.
Their representatives have ex-officio status on any of the management boards in which they participate.
The Executive Team develops agreements with the management of the partner organizations
to define the expectations and activities of the collaboration.

## Membership of the Council

Membership in the Consortium does not imply membership on the OSG Council.
The council represents the organizations that comprise the Consortium.
The Council Membership shall not exceed 30 voting members.
At least two voting slots will be held for council members at large
to represent Consortium members who do not have direct representation on the council.
At large representatives will have a term of two years.

The Council has the ability to appoint
non-voting liaisons and partnership representatives to participate in the council.

New organizations may apply for membership in the Council if supported by at least one existing member.
The proposal for participation is submitted to the Council Chair.
The Chair will consult with the Executive Team
who will make a recommendation to the Council concerning the application.
The Council formally votes on the acceptance of new members in a timely and appropriate manner.

### Council Chairpersons

At any given time, there shall be two Council Chairpersons,
either a Chair (Acting) and a Chair-Elect or a Chair (Acting) and a Past Chair.
Every two years, the Council shall self-elect a Chair-Elect,
who will serve one year in that role before becoming Chair for the following two years.
Upon the ascension of the Chair-Elect to Chair,
the preceding Chair serves as Past Chair for one year,
ending when the subsequent Chair-Elect is elected.
The accompanying diagram illustrates the scheme.

Provisions for a sustainable and resilient model are as follows:

*   Should the Chair be unable to complete the two-year term,
    the Chair-Elect will immediately become Chair and the Council will select a new Chair-Elect.
    The Council will adjust the election cycle so that
    the new Chair serves a two year’s effective term (“acting” role).

*   Should the Chair-Elect be unable to complete the one-year term,
    the Council will select a new Chair-Elect.
    This could happen during either
    (a) the overlap with an outgoing chairperson serving as backup -
    in this case, an elect is found and immediately serves as acting chair
    under the guidance of the outgoing chairperson or
    (b) immediately after the election of a chair-elect has occurred –
    in this case, a new chair-elect is elected.
    In this later case, the council chairperson may also call the council
    to endorse the second-best alternate candidate of the recent election.

*   Should neither the Chair nor the Chair-Elect be able to complete their terms,
    the OSG Executive Director will temporarily serve as Council Chair
    for the purpose of organizing the selection of a new Chair and Chair-Elect.

### Council Member Responsibilities

It is the intention that OSG Council members actively participate
in Council and Consortium activities on a regular basis.
Activities include teleconference, video-conferences, face to face meetings,
email voting, contributing to the work of the council, etc.
A regular basis is defined as participation in at least 1⁄2 of the council events during a 6 month period.

### Alternates

Council members can send alternates to meetings and activities occasionally,
but this is not considered actively participating.
Alternates are allowed to represent their respective organizations and, if empowered, vote via proxy.

### Quorum

For the sake of votes, 1/5 of the membership is considered a quorum as long as the vote is announced in advance.

A Council member can provide a voting proxy to another council member or an alternate
by contacting the Council Chair and informing the chair who has the member’s proxy.
Proxies are temporary and last for the length of a single activity (meeting, electronic vote, etc.).

## Establishment of by-laws

The bylaws and
[charter](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=25)
are accepted by majority vote according to
[the OSG Voting Procedures](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=311)
as approved at the time of the vote.
The initial bylaws and charter were accepted by consensus.

## Amendment of by-laws or charter

1.  An amendment to the bylaws or charter can be proposed by any member of the Executive Team or Council.

1.  A proposed amendment is then accepted according the OSG Voting Rules as approved at the time of the vote.
